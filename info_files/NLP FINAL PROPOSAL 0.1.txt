Final Project Proposal: Chatbot for Text Document Summarization
Project Goal
Develop a chatbot capable of summarizing text documents using two distinct approaches:

Classical NLP-Based Approach: Utilize traditional techniques like tokenization, tagging, Naive Bayes, and logistic regression.
Neural Network-Based Approach: Leverage advanced models such as RNNs or LSTMs for abstractive summarization.
This dual approach allows for a comparative analysis of their effectiveness in summarization tasks.

Relevant Work
This project builds upon course topics like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, classical machine learning algorithms, and neural network architectures (RNNs, LSTMs). Traditional NLP focuses on extractive summarization, while neural networks enable abstractive summarization.

Project Modules and Team Responsibilities
Module 1: Classical NLP-Based Summarization
Tools to Use:

Week 1–2:

Word Tokenization: Break input text into individual tokens for analysis.
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE): Handle rare and unknown words effectively.
Week 3:

Word Normalization: Convert words to a uniform form (e.g., stemming, lemmatization).
POS Tagging: Identify grammatical roles of tokens for summarization relevance.
NER (Named Entity Recognition): Extract entities to prioritize important sentences.
Word Representation: Use discrete representations and distributional semantics to understand context.
Week 4:

Word2Vec/GloVe: Use word embeddings to evaluate contextual similarity and importance.
Text Classification: Employ Naïve Bayes or Logistic Regression to rank sentences for extractive summarization.
Evaluation: Use metrics like precision and recall to assess the quality of summaries.
Team Responsibility:
One team member will focus on implementing and optimizing these tools to generate concise summaries by selecting the most relevant sentences.

Module 2: Neural Network-Based Summarization
Tools to Use:

RNN/LSTM: Develop a model to generate abstractive summaries by learning context and sequence patterns.
Dynamic Embedding: Adapt word embeddings based on the context of each occurrence.
Evaluation: Use metrics like ROUGE and BLEU to assess coherence and fluency.
Team Responsibility:
The second team member will train and evaluate neural models to summarize text effectively.

Integration of Modules
Both modules will be integrated into a chatbot interface using frameworks like Flask or Django. The chatbot will allow users to upload documents and select a preferred summarization method.

Final Outcomes
Trained Models: Classical NLP and neural network-based summarization tools.
Chatbot Application: A functional interface for text document summarization.
Comparative Analysis Report: Strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs of the two approaches.
Evaluation Plan
Technical Performance:

Use ROUGE, BLEU, precision, and recall to evaluate output quality.
User Feedback:

Conduct usability testing to gauge user satisfaction with the chatbot.
Comparison Insights:

Compare methods on factors like computational complexity, scalability, and output quality.
This project promises both a technical challenge and practical insights into modern and traditional NLP techniques for text summarization.

Next Steps for Module 1:

Clearly define the dataset for summarization tasks.
Decide how each tool (e.g., POS tagging, BPE) will directly contribute to the summarization pipeline.
Plan integration of the outputs into a ranking system for extractive summarization.
